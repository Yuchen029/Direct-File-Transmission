1. You can modify the number of client started in the `system` class.
2. After the client started, you need to type the `port `of another client than click `connect` to connect.
3. You can click `disconnect` to disconnect, but it only works after all tasks are finished.
4. Then you can click the `Begin a task` and select the file you want to transmit.
5. After selection, the file will be transmitted and another client will receive it automatically.
6. The received file will be saved to the `/save` directory and you can edit it in the `receive` class.
7. You can type the task ID and click `query` to query the task progress on both side. 
8. You can type the task ID and click `suspend` to suspend the transmission and click `continue` to continue the transmission.



PS. The `continue` function sometimes can't work.
